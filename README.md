# tpotm

Top Poster of the month is an EXTension that requires at least phpBB version 3.1.0-b3.

This is a port of the MOD I made first for phpBB2 and for phpBB3 (Olympus) then.

## Installation

### 1. clone
Clone (or download and move) the repository into the folder ext/3D-I/tpotm:

```
cd phpBB3
git clone https://github.com/3D-I/tpotm.git ext/3D-I/tpotm/
```

### 2. activate
Go to admin panel -> tab Customise -> Manage extensions -> enable tpotm

## Update instructions:
1. Go to you phpBB-Board > Admin Control Panel > Customise > Manage extensions > tpotm: disable
2. Delete all files of the extension from ext/3D-I/tpotm
3. Upload all the new files to the same locations
4. Go to you phpBB-Board > Admin Control Panel > Customise > Manage extensions > tpotm: enable
5. Purge the board cache
