Top Poster of the month is an extension that requires at least phpBB version 3.1.11 or 3.2.1.
This is a port of the MOD I made first for phpBB2 and then for phpBB3 (Olympus).

Have a Top Poster of the Month to show on your phpBB except for Banned. Founders and, Admins/Moderators can be selected by ACP panel. The last poster with the max number of posts made into the current month's gap of time will win. Custom cached data management is in the ACP's ext module along with a bunch of options.. The TPOTM's profile link works according with the - can view profile - permissions (native). Provided is a viewport customisable which containt the top posters ever since the board start date till the last minute of th previuos month (the top poster is in the present month).
